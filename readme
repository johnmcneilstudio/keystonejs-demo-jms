Including posts and galleries in the scaffolding will provide a couple of starter content types.

Initial Structure of the site
+-models
+-public
+-routes
+-templates
+-updates

'models' contains Javascript files defining the content types to be served.
There is one file per content type. http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/

'public' contains static assets

'routes' contain your applications views and controllers.

'routes/views' will contain javascript files, again one per model.
These files contain application login to interact models and render views.
If you are fluent in MVC these files could be considered the 'controllers' in the app.
So the name might be misleading, but don't let the smooth taste fool you.
KeystoneJS describes itself as MV* for those keeping score.

'templates' has one folder 'views'

'updates' contains scripts to used to update data.
These seem to be analogous to Rails migrations but it remains to be seen if these are as robust.

Cool. Things seem to be working. I can add content. And view my site. Now what?
Lets push it to the cloud for the world to see. Okay. Done. Let's take a look.
http://keystonejs-demo-jms.herokuapp.com/ returns an error.
Cloudinary is not configured according to Heroku logs.
Cloudinary breaks because there is no '.env' file.
This file contains two lines at this stage.
.env is gitignored as it should be.
But it contains the Cloudinary configuration (a Cloudinary url).
Even though I chose not to use Cloudinary it seems that the gallery and post models
are using it. Let's fix that.
Commenting out the cloudinary image fields in the

So it seems that .env needs to be available for the app.
I'm going to remove it from gitignore for now and add it back later.
