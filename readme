=======

Including posts and galleries in the scaffolding will provide a couple of starter content types.

Initial Structure of the site
+-models
+-public
+-routes
+-templates
+-updates

'models' contains Javascript files defining the content types to be served.
There is one file per content type. http://keystonejs.com/docs/database/

'public' contains static assets

'routes' contain your applications views and controllers.

'routes/views' will contain javascript files, again one per model.
These files contain application login to interact models and render views.
If you are fluent in MVC these files could be considered the 'controllers' in the app.
So the name might be misleading, but don't let the smooth taste fool you.
KeystoneJS describes itself as MV* for those keeping score.

'templates' has one folder 'views'

'updates' contains scripts to used to update data.
These seem to be analogous to Rails migrations but it remains to be seen if these are as robust.

========

Cool. Things seem to be working. I can add content. And view my site. Now what?
Lets push it to the cloud for the world to see. Okay. Done. Let's take a look.

http://keystonejs-demo-jms.herokuapp.com/ returns an error.
Cloudinary is not configured according to Heroku logs.
Cloudinary breaks because there is no '.env' file.
This file contains two lines at this stage.
.env is gitignored as it should be.
But it contains the Cloudinary configuration (a Cloudinary url) and a cookie secret.
And without these things the app seems unhappy.

heroku config:set to the rescue. The values in .env can be set in this manner.

heroku config:set COOKIE_SECRET=4b6...
heroku config:set CLOUDINARY_URL: cloudinary://3337...

These values will correspond to the values in .env after setup.

Now we need a MongoDB instance

> heroku addons:create mongolab:sandbox

After installation:

> heroku config

Duplicated the MONGODB_URI environment variable provided by the mlab MongoDB addon as 'MONGOLAB_URI'.
KeystoneJS is looking for MONGOLAB_URI value.
Another quirk. Still keeping the faith...

But now we are installed.
None of the above is necessary for development now that the instance is up.

On to customizing...

========

The default page container is a file templates/views/layouts/default.hbs
We chose handlebars as our templating engine so our templates are handlebars templates with .hbs extensions.

The home page content is in /templates/views/index.hbs
